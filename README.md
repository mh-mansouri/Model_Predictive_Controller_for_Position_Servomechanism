# Model_Predictive_Controller_for_Position_Servomechanism

Designing and Developing an Adaptive Model Predictive Controller for Position Servomechanism

This project tries to use the knowledge of MPC and adaptive MPC to control the position of a servo mechanism. The link to the reference project is mentioned as follows:
